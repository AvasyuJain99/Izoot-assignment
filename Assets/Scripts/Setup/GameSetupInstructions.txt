3. Test jump button (right half of screen)
4. Test pause button
5. Test settings volume sliders
6. Collect coins and power-ups
7. Hit obstacles to test game over

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If objects don't spawn: Check ObjectPooler and ObjectSpawner are set up correctly
- If player doesn't jump: Check jump button is assigned and PlayerController has correct jump force
- If game doesn't pause: Check GameManager and UIManager are connected
- If audio doesn't play: Check AudioManager has clips assigned and AudioSources are set up
- If ground doesn't loop: Check LoopingGround has both ground objects assigned and correct boundaries set
